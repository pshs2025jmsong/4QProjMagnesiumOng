			<h2>Thaumaturgy</h2>
			
			<p> Thaumaturgy is a mechanic in a popular Hypixel (a Minecraft server) gamemode called Skyblock. This mechanic offers players to gain stat bonuses 
			through powers. Powers are very useful, and this requires players to have accessories.</p>

			<p>This NPC above (Maxwell) will offer to apply powers to your accessories in order to gain stat boosts. In game, he explains how thaumaturgy works and 
			opens a menu where you could choose a power for your accessories.</p>
				
			<p> Each power has its own base stats and unique stat bonus/es. These stat bonuses are multiplied by the multiplier, which is calculated with magical 
			power. Each rarity of accessories grants varying magical power. Common accessories grant 3 MP (magical power) each, Uncommon accessories grant 5, 
			Rare accessories grant 8, Epic accessories grant 12, Legendary accessories grant 16, and Mythic accessories grant 22. The higher the magical power a 
			player has, the higher the multiplier.</p>
				
			<p> The purpose of this calculator is to help those who do not understand this mechanic because it is naturally difficult to understand at first, as 
			seen in players who are relatively new to this mechanic.</p>
